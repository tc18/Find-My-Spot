# Find-My-Spot
Using Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest distance for a parking spot. Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm on our campus map, In Graphical representation we convert Parking spots and Entrances as a Nodes and road which connected them as Edges with respective time as weight. Getting User's current location and empty spot from any Parking spot, Dijkstra's algorithm use these source and destination after calculating it represent minimum path between them in SVG form in browser. Environment : Java, JSP, Servlets, SVG, AJAX, Hibernate, JSON, CSS, JS, Bootstrap.
